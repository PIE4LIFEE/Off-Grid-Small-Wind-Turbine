# The Outpost (An Off-The-Grid Small Wind-Turbine)

This project is a small wind turbine utalizing the Lenz2 Wind Turbine design with a permanent magnet DC motor to run an off-grid Wifi Library and device charging station. The Library utilizes a Raspberry Pi (Model 4) configured as a WiFi access point via hostapd and dnsmasq, distributing locally stored resources through a HTTP server. The device hosts custom digital content, allowing users to access relevant materials without having an internet connection. It can be useful for multiple different applications, ranging from personal to professional/educational.
